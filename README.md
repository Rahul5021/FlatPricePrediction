# Flat Price Prediction Project  

This project involves cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing a dataset to predict flat prices. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the preprocessing includes handling duplicates, missing values, and extracting relevant features.  

Further updates on data analysis and model building will be added soon!  

## Dataset  
The dataset for this project, containing information about flats in various cities of India, is available on Kaggle.
