# Flat Price Prediction Project  

This project involves cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing a dataset to predict flat prices. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, and the preprocessing includes handling duplicates, missing values, and extracting relevant features.  

Further updates on data analysis and model building will be added soon!  

Stay tuned for more progress! ðŸš€
